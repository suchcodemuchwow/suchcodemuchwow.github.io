**Binary Search: A Step-by-Step Explanation**

**What is Binary Search?**
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by
repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed
down the possible locations to just one.

**How Does Binary Search Work?**
1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Set `low` to 0 (the first index) and `high` to `n-1` (the last index of the array).

2. **Loop Until Target Found or Range Exhausted:**
   - While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
     - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
     - Compare the element at `mid` with the target value.

3. **Adjust Pointers Based on Comparison:**
   - If the middle element is equal to the target, return `mid` (success).
   - If the middle element is less than the target, set `low` to `mid + 1` to search the right half.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, set `high` to `mid - 1` to search the left half.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, return -1 or a similar value indicating the target was
not found.

**Example Implementation (Iterative):**

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

**Handling Edge Cases:**
- **Empty Array:** If the array is empty, immediately return -1.
- **Single Element:** Directly compare the single element with the target.
- **Duplicates:** To find the first occurrence of a value, continue searching left after finding a match.
To find any occurrence, return upon the first match.

**Time Complexity:**
- **Average Case:** O(log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(log n) (when the target is at the start or end of the array)

**Space Complexity:**
- O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

**When to Use Binary Search:**
- When dealing with sorted arrays.
- For efficient searching in large datasets where time complexity is critical.

**Conclusion:**
Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for searching in sorted arrays. By understanding its
mechanics and practicing its implementation, you can enhance your problem-solving skills, particularly in
scenarios requiring optimal performance during tech interviews or software development.
